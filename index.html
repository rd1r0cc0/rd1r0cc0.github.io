    <h2 class="display-6 text-center mb-4">About Me</h2>

	<p class="fs-5">Thanks to an Air Force ROTC Scholarship, in 1998, I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida.  At that time a paradigm shift was happening from linear programming to object-oriented programming and design.  I learned how to program in assembly and C/C+, and just before graduating I learned how to program in a new language at the time, called Java.  In that same year I graduated, I was commissioned as an officer in the Air Force in the field of computers, communications, command & control and information, holding several positions over the next ten years leading teams deploying, operating, and maintaining computers, communications systems and networks from the tactical level in the desert to Air Force bases across the US and unclassified and classified networks that span the globe.  I also was fortunate enough to be a systems engineer for embedded computer and network systems on F-15 fighter jets as well as satellite ground stations for GPS and other military satellites.  I then left the military after 10 years and for the next 5 years I was a contractor and then a government civilian employee for the Air Force.  I was a systems engineer on cryptographic systems, both embedded and secure/classified networks.  In the last 10 years, I was fortunate enough to be a part of a movement to modernize how the Air Force leverages information technology and the cloud, having worked with the Air Force’s Chief Software Officer to bring the Agile and CI/CD Software Factory Concept at scale to the Air Force enterprise (DoD Platform One).  For the last three years and through today, I have taken all that I’ve learned and am now helping the Army modernize its IT infrastructure and move to the cloud, specifically by leading a 30-person team building and operating a scalable cloud-based data science platform to lower the barrier to entry for the Army’s data analysts, data scientists and data engineers.</p>
	<p class="fs-5">I am currently enrolled in MIT's xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN Boot Camp, because I wanted to get back to coding.  It's one thing to understand the latest software development techniques, concepts and practices, but it's a whole other level to actually roll up your sleeves and do it!  I want to not just lead the team, but I want to be hands-on next to them!!</p>
